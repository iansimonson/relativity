# Sim1

This simulation is not from a "real" observer. Instead it's more showing what was/is happening
after the fact. You should think of it as: What the camera is showing is a recreation of the observations made.
That's so that we can see the true position of the ship (yellow dot) at time T as well as where the three observers
(blue dots) have observed the ship to be.

The point is to show at time T that all three observers see the ship at different locations
and with vastly different _apparent_ velocities, however they can all calculate
the current relative velocity and also determine where the ship currently is.

Note, because the simulation includes an acceleration (ship goes back and forth)
there are times where the observers miscalculate _where_ the ship is as they have yet
to see the acceleration take place
