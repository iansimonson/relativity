blueshift_freq := frequency * C / (C - v)
C == speed of light
v == actual speed of object

actual speed of object == C - (frequency * C / blueshift_freq)
apparent speed of object = number of waves per 1 tick

but then need to account for time dilation:
f_b = 1/gamma * fc / (c - v)
f_r = 1/gamma * fc / (c + v)

E_b = 1/gamma * Ec / (c - v)
E_r = 1/gamma * Ec / (c + v)


E = gamma * mc^2 is the exact energy
E = 1/2 mv^2 is an approximation when V is small relative to C
